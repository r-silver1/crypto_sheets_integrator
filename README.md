<h1>Crypto Sheets Integrator</h1>
<hr>
<span>
This program is designed to update a google sheet tracking the price of a number of crypto currencies
<br>
<ul>
<li>The coins will be selected by the user and persisted in a .csv file</li>
<li>Coin prices will be updated via API call</li>
<li>Google's Credentials package and Oauth2 is used to verify user permissions
    <ul>
    <li>Permissions are persisted via package.json</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
Eventually this might get deployed in a way that can be downloaded and used directly by the public. I can't share the
credentials json per Google's terms of use (and for security reasons too). More than anything this is a test of the 
Google API for my own learning, but if someone else finds it useful to integrate into their own project or help them 
learn great!
